    <p>The conference program will kick off with a great keynote: New York University scholarly communications librarian April Hathcock, who educates the campus community on ownership, access and rights in the research lifecycle. She received her J.D. and LL.M. degrees in international and comparative law from Duke University School of Law and her M.L.I.S. from the University of South Florida. Before entering librarianship, she practiced intellectual property and antitrust law for a global private firm. Her research interests include diversity and inclusion in librarianship, cultural creation and exchange, and the ways in which social and legal infrastructures benefit the works of certain groups over others. She is the author of the article “White Librarianship in Blackface: Diversity Initiatives in LIS” and the blog At the Intersection, which examines the intersection of feminism, libraries, social justice and the law.</p><br>

    <p>When we think about what it means for libraries to act, respond, and transform in our world, we inevitably have to wrestle with the role libraries play in the racialized oppression of our society. It's a difficult and uncomfortable topic for many, but it cannot be avoided if we truly mean to live out our professional values and serve our communities. Let's take a moment to explore this issue together, focusing in on building antiracist praxis for our libraries today and into the future.</p>

    <p>Amy Fry, Bowling Green State University; Maureen Barry, Wright State University; Lindsay Miller, Miami University</p><br>

    <p>The 2016 Presidential election increased the visibility of, engagement with, and production of “fake news” – satirical, false or wildly distorted stories shared as true and manufactured for profit. This panel will feature presentations from five Ohio academic libraries that have responded to this deluge of misinformation with information literacy efforts on their campuses. A librarian from a large public university will discuss her experiences hosting a panel of faculty speakers for a high-profile, campuswide discussion series held post-election, as well as facilitating a faculty learning community on fake news and misinformation. A first-year experience librarian will discuss the course-integrated instruction her institution has done on this topic, a staff workshop she facilitated, and partnerships with faculty designed to inspire critical thinking on campus. Two librarians from another large institution will share the outcomes inspired by a community-wide event they hosted that included local activists, public librarians and other invested community citizens. A public services librarian at a branch campus library will share a LibGuide, workshop and panel her institution has developed. And a librarian at a small private college will share the results of an information literacy class’s research on fake news.</p><br>

    <p style="font-size: 16px;">A Flipped Classroom is an Inclusive Classroom: Accessibility in Online Content</p>

    <p>Kellie Tilton, University of Cincinnati Blue Ash; Becky Leporati, University of Cincinnati</p><br>

    <p>Using digital flipped classroom activities for one-shot sessions allows us to address two major instructional challenges: Time constraints and inclusion of diverse learners. Though the flipped classroom has been a staple in library instruction for several years, the increasing sophistication of eLearning tools mean new opportunities for developing effective activities. Not only do videos, interactive tutorials, and pre-class surveys help make the most of limited face-to-face time, they can also greatly increase accessibility.</p><br>

    <p>Using the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework, we seek accommodations that benefit multiple types of learners. In the online environment, this means making the most of tools like subtitles, screen reader integration, dyslexia-friendly fonts, high-contrast design, and even pause buttons for students feeling overwhelmed. Accessibility through subtitles on instructional videos, for example, makes content available for hearing impaired students, but also better for ESL students who benefit from language reinforcement and those who are someplace they cannot have sound.</p><br>

    <p>When we adopted a UDL mindset for library instruction, we quickly discovered that making our flipped classroom activities available for more students allowed all students to better engage with the material. Most importantly, the level of work and discussion in our classes significantly improved.</p><br>

    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Bridging Service: A University Library Engages On Campus With Students from China</p>

    <p>Kate Lucey, Laura Birkenhauer, and Andy Revelle (Miami University)</p><br>

    <p>Since 2012, the university has seen a 254% increase in the number of undergraduate students from China. In order to improve services for this relatively large and growing demographic, the university libraries scanned the body of literature on the subject before engaging with Chinese students more actively in the form of a study. As with former studies, this project aims to address student perspectives, student use of resources, and outreach effectiveness prefaced with an awareness of cultural differences. Librarians interviewed Chinese students on campus in order to assess their information needs and service expectations. Based on trends and themes identified in the interview transcripts, the librarians then developed a survey that was distributed to Chinese students on a larger scale at the university.</p><br>

    <p>Jane Wu, Otterbein University</p><br>

    <p>China is one of the leading sources of international students for the United States, and these students comprise the largest proportion (31.5%) of international students in this country. Demographic shift and increasing diversity in the student population demand educators to provide culturally responsive instruction for students. To build culturally sustaining pedagogy, librarians need to use critical library instruction model that encourage to engages students' prior knowledge and their skills, whether the intent is to build on that knowledge, to interrogate it, or to situate new ways of thinking. Based on my sabbatical research with gathered qualitative and quantitative data, the presentation will explore the information literacy (IL) standards, practices and state of information literacy education in China. It also illustrates the social, cultural, political and practice differences associated with IL programs in Chinese academic libraries. The findings provide a framework through which to deeper understand the past library experiences of Chinese international students, their information need and seeking behavior before coming to the United States. This will also assist the librarians to explore effective teaching methodologies and strategies and implement a culturally responsive IL education program that supports academic success of the Chinese international students.</p><br>

    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Critical Thinking and the ACRL Framework: Combating Fake News and Fallacies</p>

    <p>Mandi Goodsett, Cleveland State University</p><br>

    <p>Critical thinking, while often used as a mere buzzword, is clearly relevant to the mission and expertise of librarians. Especially now, as our students encounter fake news, radically conflicting viewpoints in the media, and apparent authorities who disregard facts, academic librarians, led by the ACRL Framework, are in a prime position to develop the skills necessary to empower students to navigate this tumultuous sea of ideas.</p><br>

    <p>Critical thinking is characterized by the careful, reflective judgement of ideas as a guide for action. The dispositions and skills of critical thinking share a lot with the ACRL Frameworks’ frame, “Authority is Constructed and Contextual,” which many librarians are already attempting to incorporate into their teaching. Informed by the critical thinking education literature, librarians teaching about authority (even in one-shot library sessions) can encourage critical thinking skills and dispositions, which help students overcome their own flawed thinking and make better decisions. This presentation will explore the many decades of research about critical thinking in the classroom, and demonstrate its application to information literacy instruction.</p><br>

    <p>Nick Pavlik, Bowling Green State University; Michelle Sweetser, Bowling Green State University; Radhika Gajjala, Bowling Green State University</p><br>

    <p>This presentation focuses on a new partnership between the BGSU Center for Archival Collections (CAC) and College of Media and Communication that aims to create training opportunities, support materials, and submission workflows to empower members of the University community to capture the stories of the broader communities of which they are a part or with whom they have established relationships, with a particular emphasis on documenting migrant, immigrant, and non-citizen resident experiences in the Toledo and Northwest Ohio region. Following a report on the project, the presenters plan to engage the audience in a discussion of the barriers to the creation of oral histories centered on underdocumented populations. With limited time and resources to undertake largescale oral history projects, is it possible for archivists to empower community members to engage in these activities on our behalf? What do the archival and migrant communities gain and/or lose by empowering community members to capture these stories? What resources or training do archivists believe community members need in order to “do” oral history and what resources do those within the community believe they need? How do we negotiate those differences?</p><br>

    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Empowering Partnerships: Exploring the School Library Envrionment to Promote College Student Success</p>

    <p>Katy Mathuews, Ohio University; Zachary Lewis, Shawnee State University</p><br>

    <p>Student college readiness is a concern in higher education, particularly in the Appalachian region where secondary students, teachers, and school districts may face a variety of challenges. To bridge the college readiness gap, the presenters visited the school libraries of each high school in one Appalachian Ohio county. The goal of the project was to examine the physical space and explore the resources and experiences available to high school students. The project enables school and academic librarians to understand students’ library environments and experiences. This understanding helps align student preparation and maximize success in the post-secondary environment. The presentation will share photos and highlight findings about resources and student experiences from the high school library visits. The presenters will compare and contrast the high school library and post-secondary library environments to deepen the understanding of the spaces in which students form expectations of and gain experience with libraries. Attendees will take away an expanded perspective of the environments and resources students may experience in high school libraries. The presenters will engage the audience in discussion to create academic library action items based on the findings from high school libraries.</p><br>

    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Empowering Stories of Library Impact and Advocacy</p>

    <p>Eric Resnis, Miami University</p><br>

    <p>Your library accomplishes great things, but how do you effectively tell that story to library stakeholders and administrators? Furthermore, how do you build upon those stories to advocate for what you and/or your library needs to continue the great work? Many factors play into this such as political realities, institutional priorities, and even personalities. Having a working knowledge of these factors and techniques for navigating them can help you to effectively demonstrate the impact of your library from wherever you reside in the organization.</p><br>

    <p>This highly-interactive session will explore communication and meaning-making frameworks and how they relate to telling the story of your library’s impact. We’ll also explore ways to translate that story into advocacy. Bring stories of your library’s great work to share, and be prepared to take more great ideas home with you!</p><br>

    <p>Emily A. Hicks, University of Dayton Libraries</p><br>

    <p>Teams make better decisions, develop more creative solutions, and achieve a higher level of productivity when the group has a high level of trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of group efficacy. This presentation will discuss the role of leadership, followership, and group emotional intelligence in teams and the implications for libraries. Good followership is vital in today’s highly collaborative, team-oriented libraries because the line between leaders and those they lead is often blurred. The key to defining followership, as in leadership, lies with the relationship between leaders and followers. Effective followers possess skills that allow them to effect change without causing harm to the organization. This takes a high degree of emotional intelligence. Both individual and group emotional intelligence involve the personal competence of being aware of and regulating one’s own emotions and the social competence of being aware of and regulating the emotions of others.</p><br>

    <p>Nimisha Bhat, Columbus College of Art &amp; Design</p><br>

    <p>Diversity initiatives have been appropriated as trendy incentives at libraries around the country. To prevent diversity from being a trend and to continuously support our multifaceted communities, libraries need to create sustainable and tangible services that allow our marginalized users to feel represented and supported. In academic libraries book displays offer opportunities for campus outreach, the promotion of inclusivity, and the engagement of diverse user communities. This presentation will demonstrate how curating library displays and providing open questions on a centrally-placed whiteboard can prompt students to think critically about social justice issues, open up a dialogue between peers, and get students interested in library collections that reflect diverse representation.</p><br>

    <p style="font-size: 16px;">From Invisible to Just Within Our Sights: Constructing Pedagogical Supports for Transfer Students in Academic Libraries</p>

    <p>Thomas Atwood, The University of Toledo</p><br>

    <p>Academic librarians have always been the first to act and respond to the needs of diverse populations on their campuses, partnering with other constituents and raising awareness in order to ensure student success. In the last few years, universities have experienced a tremendous influx of nontraditional students returning to learn, military students, along with students transferring from other institutions. Historically, this population was perceived as being relatively small and not prioritized. As the number of transfer students increases, universities are challenged in meeting the needs of this fluctuating population. University libraries are in an optimal position to actively support these students’ academic success; however, academic libraries have not focused on this phenomenon because of their traditional philosophy of cohort literacy. It is both incumbent on university libraries and other campus constituents to initiate a conversation in order to develop and implement reciprocal strategies for these students that ensure their pathway to an environment of empathy, acceptance, and congruency, ultimately supporting their retention and success. By recognizing the needs of this population and the different spheres of transfer, academic librarians can transform the learning environment and initiate a dialogue to rethink their approach from cohort learning to a more person-centered approach.</p><br>

    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Gamified Goal Setting and Academic Allies: Offering First-Year Students a “Gameful” Path to Thriving</p>

    <p>Christopher Younkin, The Ohio State University Libraries</p><br>

    <p>Research shows that goal setting and social connectedness are important components of thriving in college. In the fall of 2016, we piloted an information literacy workshop at our large research university library that taught first-year students game-based strategies with potential to help them set personally meaningful academic goals and make social connections in the libraries that enhance their efforts. The workshop offered an alternative approach to managing learning that emphasized gamefulness—tapping into the positive, creative mindset common to gameplay—to empower students to take charge of their own education.</p><br>

    <p>Research used in the development of our workshop reveals compelling evidence that game-based approaches to learning foster motivation, and that cultivating a gameful mindset helps people overcome major obstacles and build self-efficacy. Several participants in this pilot workshop expressed that the gameful strategies they learned could make the daunting tasks of academic work more manageable and even fun. Our approach was low-tech, relying more on imagination than software.</p><br>

    <p>Participants in this interactive presentation will discover what research in student thriving and gamefulness teaches us about empowering students to tackle real-world challenges with the positive mindset associated with gameplay, brainstorm possible applications of these strategies, and play games.</p><br>

    <p style="font-size: 16px;">How to Assess and Report Accessibility of Online Library Resources</p>

    <p>Meghan Frazer, OhioLINK; Debbie Tenofsky, University of Cincinnati; Katie Gibson, Miami University</p><br>

    <p>As a matter of professional principle, librarians believe in access to library materials for all. Given the complex nature of online databases and multi-faceted publisher platforms, however, it can be difficult to determine if a resource is truly accessible for all of our users. Users with disabilities may have increased difficulty navigating these resources if the vendor is not adhering to accessibility standards in development. Librarians must identify the accessibility shortcomings in our online resources in order to proactively assist users in the short-term and persuade vendors to make these products more accessible in the long-term.</p><br>

    <p>In response to this problem, a small task force of Ohio librarians has developed a system for evaluating library resources against web accessibility standards. The system includes a standard evaluation matrix based on individual guidelines from Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 and a report template designed to easily communicate evaluation findings to stakeholders. In this presentation, the attendees will learn about the template, how to customize it for their own evaluations and how the results might influence accessible software development. The task force will also discuss best practices for working through the evaluation and reporting process.</p><br>

    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Information Literacy and Social Justice</p>

    <p>Sean Socha, Capital University</p><br>

    <p>The rise of fake news has drawn attention to information literacy skills and concepts, and for good reason. As librarians have always professed, these skills are important to research and lifelong learning, but now they are even more essential to secure us against threats to our democracy. Information literacy skills have become weaponized in the fight for social justice as citizens now contend with alternate facts and efforts to discredit expertise in general and even science itself. Libraries and librarians are uniquely positioned to uphold and disseminate vital information literacy skills, concepts, and frames in order to empower our patrons and stakeholders.</p><br>

    <p>This presentation will detail efforts librarians can make on university campuses to broaden the discussion about fake news, and to address issues of social justice as they relate to information literacy. The presentation will cover specific efforts by the presenter, including serving on a faculty panel about fake news, creating a resource-rich LibGuide on fighting fake news, and taking part in a Day of Action Teach-In to lead a discussion on the social justice implications of information literacy. The session will begin a dialogue around how the library community can best meet the growing needs of an information overloaded society.</p><br>

    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Looking Forward to Look Back: Digital Preservation Planning</p>

    <p>Jennifer Brancato, University of Dayton; Kayla Harris, University of Dayton</p><br>

    <p>Digital information resources are a vitally important and increasingly large component of academic libraries’ collection and preservation responsibilities. This includes content converted to and originating from digital form (born-digital). Preserving digital material, such as social media and websites, is essential for ensuring that future generations know everyone’s story, especially those groups which have been historically underrepresented in official records. This presentation will detail the steps undertaken by a digital preservation task force to first assess the weaknesses in current practice, and then develop a plan to implement a digital preservation policy and workflow. As part of the project, the task force compiled and evaluated digital preservation policies from several academic libraries, created an RFI, and invited vendors to campus. Initiated by the library, digital preservation involves many stakeholders on campus who were included in this process. Even with varying resources and technical expertise, attendees will be empowered to start the process of creating their own digital preservation policy and plan. Addressing digital preservation is daunting, but the first step is to act.</p><br>

    <p>Lorraine Wochna, Ohio University; Teresa Simmons, Kettering College; Allen Reichert, Otterbein University</p><br>

    <p>Sure, it seems that everyone has a Netflix account. But how does that really work for the library in support of research and instruction? If you have a student researching the Ukraine, is Oleg’s Choice, a feature film on Kanopy an acceptable replacement for Winter on Fire, a documentary, which is only on Netflix? Where can we find good documentaries and educational video and how do you talk about documentaries with students? Should this be part of their research strategy, and what should they look for? How about that faculty member that wants to show the HBO film Class Divide on campus; can she?</p><br>

    <p>Our presentation will address issues of media literacy through the lens of documentary films, primarily those films available through streaming. We will discuss strategies to help students evaluate these sources and determine if they are valuable for their research. The discussion will include resources for libraries that want to offer streaming documentaries, as well as some examples and outcomes of faculty using film in the classroom. Finally, we’ll look at some of the issues with the streaming market, particularly direct to streaming documentaries hosted only on specific platforms, such as Netflix or Amazon.</p><br>

    <p>Daniela Solomon, Case Western Reserve University; Brian Gray, Case Western Reserve University; Evan Meszaros, Case Western Reserve University; Yuening Zhang, Case Western Reserve University</p><br>

    <p>How do librarians discover increased buying powers as book budgets are negatively influenced by annual subscription inflation? A group of science and engineering collection managers decided to pilot new approaches to building collections across various disciplines by leveraging “shared” money and vendor willingness to explore alternative models to acquisition. In using several models of book collection development (subscription, patron driven, and evidence-based), the librarians drastically increased the amount of content available to the library users, while providing mechanisms to better understand the true research needs and actions of the library users. A trust and mutual understanding was developed to learn from each librarian’s area of expertise and define the goals over the several year commitment to not doing traditional “one book at a time” purchase decisions.</p><br>

    <p>Lae'l Hughes-Watkins, Kent State University Libraries</p><br>

    <p>Project STAND (STudent Activism Now Documented) is a collaborative effort starting with various Ohio universities to create an online clearinghouse where academic institutions can provide researchers access to historical and archival documentation on the development and ongoing occurrences of student dissent. Project STAND will focus on the digital and analog primary sources that document the activities of student groups that represent the concerns of historically marginalized communities (e.g African American, Latinx, LGBTQ, religious minorities, disabled), while also highlighting the work of others (e.g., faculty, staff, and administrators) who advocate for or support the interests of those communities. The presentation will provide insight into the catalyst for this project, it’s long-term goals/objectives, and how this initiative will help participating repositories feel empowered and engaged in discourse regarding equity and social justice within their local communities and at the national level.</p><br>

    <p>The presentation will also discuss efforts to address ethical concerns and the impact of social media in archiving as it relates to student organizations and their political/social actions. The presentation and efforts of Project STAND is timely with projects such as Documenting the Now and various efforts to capture student activism, past and present.</p><br>

    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Research as Transformative Experience: Authority and Autoethnography</p>

    <p>Beate Gersch, University of Akron</p><br>

    <p>Intellectual and personal transformation is typically a long, and sometimes uncomfortable process that involves an element of self-reflection. Librarians would be hard pressed to advertise library instruction sessions as transformational experiences; yet, each one of our instructional encounters offers the opportunity to shape students’ dispositions toward concepts of information literacy, as outlined in the ACRL Framework. This session illustrates how an autoethnography assignment or exercise can be integrated into library instruction sessions to explore the concept of authority as constructed and contextual. Exploring information resources through an autoethnographic lens personalizes the research process for students and invites their critical reflection on potential gaps between their own perception of facets of their identity (avowal) and the representation of these facets by others (ascription), including systems of information organization (controlled vocabulary). This presentation offers ideas on how to turn research strategies, (e.g., concept maps and keyword searches) into tools for negotiating cultural identity. By exploring information resources through an autoethnographic lens, students will discover how these resources are embedded in and shaped by hierarchical relationships of authority and power, which in turn will empower students to become more critical users of information.</p><br>

    <p>Holly Dean, Pellissippi State Community College; JD Burnette, Pellissippi State Community College/AmeriCorp Vista</p><br>

    <p>Seed libraries have the power to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Engage diverse populations through Active learning programming and partnerships</li>

      <li>Respond to the food insecurity needs of their community with sustainable practices</li>

      <li>Transform perspectives of the library through nontraditional resources and services</li>

      <li>Empower students, staff, and faculty with the information to lead healthy, impactful lifestyles</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Partnerships between academic libraries, faculty, and outreach/service programs can empower individuals and institutions to establish a strong sustainably-minded community. Leadership roles, mentors, and partnerships are born through creative programming and outreach services to diverse communities of students, faculty and staff.</p><br>

    <p>This session will share how community college librarians partnered with their campus garden, local and national organizations, campus food pantry, teaching faculty, and service-learning students to establish a Seed Library. Lessons learned, future programming, and goals will be also be discussed.</p><br>

    <p style="font-size: 16px;">The Art of Empowerment: Servant Leadership as a Management Philosophy</p>

    <p>Susan M. Frey, Indiana State University; Valentine K. Muyumba, Indiana State University</p><br>

    <p>Servant leadership is a secular management approach that has been embraced in the management sciences since the 1990s. The most striking characteristic of servant leaders is that they tie power to social justice. This leadership philosophy can be successfully employed by anyone, but since managers have positional power within the organization it is often they who have the greatest opportunity to employ it. In this interactive session two librarian supervisors present two highly challenging academic library management cases informed by their experience, and by the professional literature. Through a series of group activities attendees will be challenged to use case study analysis to apply the basic tenets of servant leadership, which will be presented to them beforehand. The goal of these group exercises is not to find one right answer, or to seek group consensus. Instead, this session will offer attendees a positive, respectful, and practical mechanism for empowering coworkers by dealing with them in radically new ways. The presenters will provide attendees with a handout synopsizing the tenants of servant leadership, and a bibliography of scholarly resources from the management and educational leadership disciplines for further investigation. This session will be one-third presentation, and two-thirds intensive group activity.</p><br>

    <p style="font-size: 16px;">They’re doing what?! How we responded to disappearing government data by hosting a DataRescue Event.</p>

    <p>Eric Johnson, Miami University; Thomas Gerrish, Miami University; Thomas Tully, Miami University</p><br>

    <p>This panel will discuss the process, experiences, and results of holding "DataRescue" events.</p><br>

    <p>The newly formed DataRescue movement attempts to protect at-risk federal data. This includes data related to climate change, racial or housing inequities, and other issues not supported by the current U.S. administration. Libraries in this movement host DataRescue events - scheduled gatherings during which people identify data and websites in need of protection. Volunteers download data, add metadata and send the data to repositories for storage and dissemination.</p><br>

    <p>Librarians typically want to protect the availability of government information and have organization skills needed for this movement.</p><br>

    <p>Participants will experience "hands-on" practice in rescuing data and be encouraged to ask questions of the panelists as they learn how they can respond to the need and of the support available to them and their patrons.</p><br>

    <p>With every new presidential administration, government websites change. Changes can be as minor as website header updates or as large as the removal of access to entire datasets. These data are critical for scholarly communications, research, policy decisions, and an informed citizenry, which touches everyone, but their availability is particularly vulnerable to changes in government funding and administrative policy. Data can also become unavailable during government shutdowns and historic data can be lost.</p><br>

    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Transform the Path of a Library Career: Empowering Librarians Through Mentoring</p>

    <p>Beth Tumbleson, Miami University Regionals; John Burke, Miami University Regionals</p><br>

    <p>Mentoring empowers the next generation of librarians to assume positions of leadership and expertise in our profession. Successful mentoring requires a combination of commitments from library administrators, professional organizations, and individuals who will provide and receive mentoring. How can we strengthen professional development and retention within library systems, and also draw on the hard-won professional lessons of experienced librarians?</p><br>

    <p>The presenters will draw together material from survey results, the library literature, and their personal experiences to address mentorship in academic libraries. Aspects identified and discussed will include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Approaches to mentoring in librarianship, including formal, informal, peer, team-based, residence programs, communities of practice, regional or national associations, in-person, or online.</li>

      <li>Groups likely to benefit from mentoring,such as tenure or promotional track librarians, first year librarians, MLIS student interns, and underrepresented groups in the profession.</li>

      <li>What mentees typically seek in a mentor.</li>

      <li>How successful mentors connect and coach, and how to negotiate challenges in mentoring relationships such as cross-generational or cultural issues.</li>

      <li>Best practices in mentoring, including the frequency and duration of meetings, and communication strategies like shared online accounts, using discussion prompts, and more.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Learn how you, your library, and professional organizations can invest in future librarians through mentoring!</p><br>

    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Transforming the Future: Teaching Student Employees Self-Advocacy and Empowering Them to Lead at Work</p>

    <p>Amanda Koziura, Case Western Reserve University</p><br>

    <p>Empowering students to strive for equity and to advocate for themselves is not always at the forefront of our minds when we hire, but the development these skills can easily be integrated into the student work experience. Through developing a work environment where feedback is valued, ideas are encouraged, and self-advocacy is the norm, student employees are empowered to affect change around them and bring their unique perspectives to help improve library operations. Employers can also model these traits by advocating for their employees, seeking opportunities for fair pay, and giving students the opportunity to lead in the workplace. This presentation will explore the journey of a digital scholarship center as it strove to bring these values to the forefront and how it has positively impacted both the student employees and the library. Attendees will take away a framework they can apply to their own student employment opportunities to empower students to self-advocate and impact their work environment positively. They will also have the option of participating in short roleplay scenarios used in training to help students learn these skills.</p><br>

    <p style="font-size: 16px;">What We (don’t) Talk About When We Talk About Diversity</p>

    <p>Ione Damasco, University of Dayton</p><br>

    <p>In 2012, ACRL issued a document outlining eleven diversity standards for academic libraries to use in developing the skills and competencies that are necessary to serve diverse populations. ALA lists “diversity” as one of its 11 core values. Lately, the rhetoric around “diversity” has expanded to include the terms “inclusion” and “equity.” Typically, when we use the word “diversity” we refer to specific categories of identity: race, gender, ability, and sexual orientation, to name a few. As colleges and universities engage in more diversity initiatives, how is the conversation around diversity, equity, and inclusion taking shape? What do we mean when we talk about diversity in academic libraries? What is left unsaid when these conversations take place? Focusing on race, this session will challenge attendees to unpack, rethink and reframe the diversity conversation. The presenter will share findings from a content analysis project of academic library diversity plans, provide a brief overview of critical race scholarship in the field, and challenge attendees to think critically about current library rhetoric around race. Attendees will come away from this session with new frameworks to consider as the foundation for anti-racist work not just in academic libraries but higher education as a whole.</p><br>
