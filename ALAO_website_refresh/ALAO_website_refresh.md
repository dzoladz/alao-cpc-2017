We'll need to set a clear set of objectives, timelines, and schedule of deliverables.

- Branding Board (Web Design Style Guide) for ALAO to standarized and guide our use of color and font in communications with our membership. These guidelines will be used by the web team during the refresh. Standardized typograhpy and color palettes go a long way.

#### **PRIMARY HEX VALUES AND PRIMARY LOGOS**

These colors would be based off of our primary ALAO logo.

![Example color from OPAL guidelines](formal_colors.png)

#### **SELECTION OF A PRIMARY FONT STYLE**


Design and instruction on using small set of primary fonts.

![Example fonts from OPAL guidelines](formal_fonts.png)


There are numerous examples that can be reviewed with a simple Google search. Recommendations would be to include some guideance for (1) Typography, (2) Color, (3) and photography. [Berkeley Guidelines](http://brand.berkeley.edu/visual-design/)

#### Preparation

- Begin to think about the clean-up and consistent application of elements on IG, committee, and other templates sitewide. For instance, heading styles (H2, H3) and lists.
- Begin to plan for replicating the structure of the ACRL archtiecture on the ALAO redeigned site
- Review content with consultant and acquire recommendations: Interest group template needs to list: (1) Current co-chairs, (2) Communications methods, (3) Charge of the group. The previous information will be available in the IG templates. IGs will be able to customize any other sections of their page to include other means of engagement with their membership. Webmasters will not maintain these IG pages. IG Co-chairs will be responsible for adhering to the web design guidelines for any content that is added to their page that is outside of the scope of the template.

#### Information Architecture
- Currently, the ALAO top-level navigation has a "Get Involved" section. For simplicy, the content of this page could be expanded and improved to provide information on the various ways for our membership to interact with ALAO; list volunteer opportunities, projects, and contacts; provide leadership opporunities within, and outside of, ALAO; and highlight other methods of interacting with and between our membership base.
- Seperate the options to "Join" vs. "Review". For an example, [See ACRL Website](http://www.ala.org/acrl/)

Reviewing the Google Analytics data from the previous 365 days, we take a look at the active users report for the year.

Scaling down to the date range of (Decemeber 1st, 2017 - January 10th, 2018), we'll see an anomolous spike in connections to the ALAO website building up to the announcement of the December newsletter. However, the majority of the days are seeing fewer than 35 unique users in a day.
